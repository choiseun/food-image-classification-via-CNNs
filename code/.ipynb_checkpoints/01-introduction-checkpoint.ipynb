    "In this project, I hope to accomplish the following objectives:\n",
    "- Collect and clean at least 200 images per food class for 5 classes using the pushshift.io Reddit API,\n",
    "- Build a convolutional neural network from scratch to predict multiclass food classes with accuracy, precision, and recall scores that beat those of the null model, and\n",

    "Given more resources, the optimal way to collect image data would have been through a web API for Google Images. Unfortunately, this would have required securing a bigger budget and navigating the nuances of the /robots.txt page for Google Images (which is very particular about what is and is not allowed). Thus, for practical reasons, I chose to collect the image data using the pushshift.io Reddit API. The links to the data have been provided below:\n",
